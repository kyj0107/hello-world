# Markdown and Github!
### by Karla Jaime
I'm beginning to think we have all used some form of markdown at some point in our lives. Have you heard of Tumblr or Discord? I don't know if Tumblr does this anymore--this is pretty much impossible to do on the mobile versions of Tumblr, but I think this is still possible on desktop--but you could write your posts in HTML. After reading those articles about Markdown, I realized that Discord uses Markdown! I've been using Markdown for the past two years and I didn't realize it until now! Well, I've been using them for fun, not for anything serious. I guess this will be my first time using Markdown for something serious...like this final project.

## Hmmm, how did I decide to major in Information Technology?

Where do I start? Well, I wanted to be an artist when I was little, but my sister immediately shut down that idea by saying that artists don't get paid a lot. I don't even remember how I got into computers the first time, but here I am, taking this class and making this final project. I *have* actually messed with GitHub at some point, although I haven't actually touched it in...three years. GitHub has changed a lot since I last used it, and it's honestly nice to have a bit of a refresher! Anyway...

I have actually worked with Python, but only for a few months in my first year of high school. I don't even remember what we covered, because we spent only a couple of months on one programming language and then unceremoniously moved on to the next. What was it that we worked on? Let's see...

1. Scratch
2. Some application to create apps on Android (I actually don't remember the name, but I think it was Android Studio...?)
3. Python
4. HTML
5. Javascript

...and that's about all I can remember.

I enrolled in another computer class my sophomore year of high school. It was a bit awkward being surrounded by guys--out of the sea of guys, it was just me and this other girl. We spent the entire year working on Java (the same code used for *Minecraft*), but the teacher didn't exactly do a good job of teaching us. I can't really critique a teacher since I have no experience in teaching myself, but this teacher just gave us assignments and told us to work. I don't think he ever gave us examples to work off of. Admittedly, I don't really think ahead. I end up spending a lot of time brute-forcing code until I get it to work. Usually, it works! The way I say see it, there's no point in writing down code you think will work, typing it all in, and then testing it only to find that it doesn't work. For some reason, it's just easier for me to try out code and keep altering it until I get it to work the way I want it to.

My junior year of high school, I enrolled in a cybersecurity class. However, it was taught by the same teacher, and he just gave us assignments and told us to work without really teaching us anything. This was around the time when I got interested in CTC (Career and Technology Center), which was held at a different school from mine. I was interviewed by someone from that school, and I got accepted into the Cybersecurity program! And, considering that this was more hands-on work than just staring at a computer and browsing through potentially dangerous files all hour, I was definitely looking forward to it.

CTC was...interesting, to put it politely. Otherwise, it was one of the weirdest yet most enlightening experiences I've ever had. My classmates were *weird*, and I mean **weird**. Not a bad weird, but just...*weird*. I learned a few weird things in that class, including:

* Animal Crackers contain a lot of protein (that's actually not true, but it was kind of a joke for a hot minute)
* A hacker could die trying to crack your password if your password was the entire script of *The Bee Movie*
* Don't lean on wheeled chairs. Ever.
* This is a field where you basically trade your eyesight for a job working on a computer. Seriously, everyone except one kid out of twelve in that class needed some form of correction for their eyesight, including me.

It's not like I didn't learn anything from that class at all! I learned to configure a switch and a router, change the IP address on a Windows machine, plug in certain cables for certain things... It was almost like review from the cybersecurity class that I'd taken the year before, except this class lasted three hours a day and the teacher did a better job of teaching us. I still don't know how it happened, but I'd actually been nominated Student of the Year by the cybersecurity instructor!

## Am I bilingual if I can understand a second language but can't speak it?

Hmmm... how do you put an image in here?

There's a weird story behind this image. Last December, my family visited my mom's relatives in southern--I'm talking *southern*--Mexico. Washers and dryers are expensive as all heck over there, so people usually get just a washer. Besides, why waste precious electricity or gas when you can just hang your clothes on clotheslines and dry them out in the scorching sun for free? The only downside is that wrinkles happen. Anyway, on a few of the days in those two weeks in Mexico, my family and my mom's brother went to San Cristobal. While visiting San Cristobal, we stayed at a relative's house in a town nearby. It was *so*, **so** ridiculously sunny outside that clothes dried quickly and my glasses turned dark *really fast*--I have transition lenses, and they make my glasses sunglasses if they're exposed to UV light, and there was *a lot* of UV light in that area. Anyway, one day I was hanging clothes to dry when a butterfly landed on my tie-dye T-shirt. It just sat there for...minutes. It didn't move unless I got close enough. It just sat there. And then it finally left.

So! The thing about southern Mexico, specifically Chiapas, is that it's consistently hot. And humid? Well, it wasn't *that* humid when I went there. In comparison, Missouri is a swamp!
