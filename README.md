# Markdown and Github!
## by Karla Jaime

Hmm... Where do I start? Well, I've come to the conclusion that we're completely surrounded by Markdown and HTML...in the sense that you can use them while making posts on social media. Let's look at Tumblr and Discord. Tumblr--I don't know if it still does this on desktop, but I know for a fact that it's pretty much impossible on mobile--gives you the option to create a post using HTML. You can definitely use HTML when writing your description and creating pages on your blog. Discord uses Markdown. Basically, I've been messing with Markdown for the past two years! It was never for anything serious, though. This will be the first time that I'm using Markdown for anything serious...like this final project!

## How did we get here

I was considering a career in art, but my sister kind of shut down that idea because "artists don't get paid as much as more 'practical' jobs". I like to think of myself as a decent artist, even though realism is *not* my thing. Anyway, I don't know when I became interested in computers so much, but I took computer classes in high school.

The first class, the one in my freshman year of high school, was basically an introducting to a bunch of computer languages. The thing is, we only really focused on a programming language for a month or two, and then we moved on to the next thing. Let's see if I can remember which languages we used...

1. Scratch
2. Android App Maker (well, it was an app-developing..app...on Android, but I don't remember the actual name for it)
3. Python
4. CSS
5. HTML
6. Javascript

...and that's about all I remember. We also messed with GitHub in this class, but because it's been *years* since I used it I desperately needed a refresher for this final project. It doesn't help that (I think) a lot has changed since I last used GitHub. Repositories, branches--it's all too complicated and annoying! Oh, well. If I'm going into a field like this, I might as well learn how to use it. Although...do you really need GitHub when you're configuring routers and switches for a living?

In my sophomore year of high school, I took another computer class. This class focused on Java for the entire year, but...the teacher wasn't exactly good at his job. I can't really criticize a teacher since I've never teached myself, but I'm sure we can all agree that giving your students assignments and telling them to work without giving them examples to work off of or how to use certain keywords in Java isn't exactly the best way to teach, right?

I hear that it's a good idea to plan your code on paper before you jump into the real deal, but let me ask you something: how often do you find yourself writing code for hours, finally plugging it all in to test it, and realizing you wasted several hours writing code that wouldn't work to begin with? The only things you really get out of that are hand cramps and pencil marks on the side of your hand. That's why I just brute-force my way through code--I plug in what I think will work, immediately test it, and--since Python actually tells you where the error occurs and why--correct anything.

Anyway, I found out halfway into the year that the class that I had signed up for was actually an AP class--I don't know if this really explains why the teacher just expected us to know what we were doing--and, well, I didn't take the AP test for that class. I did, however, leave the class with trauma associated with Java. Hopefully, by the time we get around to learning Java while I'm in college, I'll be able to actually learn something and have it stick.

My junior year of high school came around, and my school just added a new class: Cybersecurity. I was more excited about cybersecurity than I was about coding, so I signed up for the class. However, it was taught by the same teacher from the previous year, and it was basically the same story: "Here's your assignment, now do the work." I mean, I *did* learn a few things in that class--like finding suspicious files. Why is it that Windows hides extensions by default? That's so dumb. I'd also like to know why they just have the system32 folder out in the open and easily accessible to some random user who plans to cause mischief...or just outright destroy the computer.

This was around the time that I got interested in the Career and Technology Center program. It's a thing that happens at a school in a different town from mine, and since they have a Cybersecurity program AND I can leave my school for three hours a day, I seriously considered it. They interview students who sign up for the program. A week or so after my own interview, I got a little yellow card saying I'd been accepted for the Cybersecurity program!

So my senior year of high school, I took a bus every day to go to CTC in the afternoon. I will say that my classmates were...weird. Like, **weird** weird. Not a bad weird, but just...*weird*. We were all video-game addicts who rambled about Super Smash Bros. and memes. I learned a few weird things from this class:

* Animal Crackers contain a ton of protein (this is actually not true, but this was a joke for a hot minute when one of the kids in the Cybersecurity program decided to eat an entire jar of Animal Crackers for lunch)
* It would literally take forever for a hacker to crack your password if your password was the entire script of *The Bee Movie* (this was actually my dumb idea)
* My classmates might be my coworkers some day, and they're all a bunch of nerds who reek of Mountain Dew, Doritos, and video games.
* This is a field where you basically exchange your eyesight for a job working at a computer. Seriously, everyone except for, like, two out of twelve students in that afternoon class wore some form of corrective eyewear. I wore contacts and glasses, five other kids wore glasses, and the remaining four just wore contact lenses.

Overall, the experience was weird yet really, *really* enlightening. We went over stuff about networking and different kinds of encryption for protecting passwords and the like on routers and switches, we actually configured routers and switches a few times, and we messed around with this program called Cisco Packet Tracer.

Anyway, as you all are aware, COVID-19 spread to Missouri in March, and they closed down all the schools and switched to online learning. The same went for CTC. After the school year ended, I had to go in to do a thing or two, and I found out that, for some reason, my Cybersecurity instructor had actually nominated me for Student of the Year! I got a certificate and everything.

So yeah. The experience at CTC pretty much solidified my idea of working in Information Technology. So here we are!

## Bilingual Time

Last December, my family traveled to southern--I mean, *southern*--Mexico to see my mom's relatives. Tapachula, the city my mom was raised in, is, like, right on the border of Guatemala. Hopefully, that gives you a semi-decent idea of where it is. And it's consistently hot--the lowest would be 70, the highest would be 90 or even hotter, and it was, like, always bright and sunny. I don't remember a single day when it rained in during those two weeks in Mexico! Of course, you were also surrounded by Spanish-speaking natives, Spanish signs, Spanish...**everything**. Also, the Walmart in Tapachula has an entire aisle for chocolate. As an American whose first language is English, I read it as "chawk-let". But this is Mexico we're talking about, so it's "choe-coe-lah-teh". I was wondering, "Wait, why is the word 'chocolate' in English?" It's not in English--Spanish just spells it the same way.

I don't remember much of the trip, but I do remember a bit about San Cristobal. It's basically a place in the mountains with ridiculously bright, colorful houses. No, seriously, if you were looking for someone who lived in that neighborhood, people would just tell you which colored house to go to--*those houses didn't have addresses!*

I mean, *look at this*!

![San Cristobal houses](https://www.filmingperu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SAN-CRISTOBAL-04.jpg)

And while I'm at it, here's the Wikipedia page on [San Cristobal de las Casas.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Crist%C3%B3bal_de_las_Casas)

Better yet, [here's the Wikipedia page Chiapas.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiapas)

Anyway, my family went to San Cristobal. At some point, we were delayed because of some...avalanche or something...further ahead that blocked the road, so there was a guy who came up to us and told us which way to go that would still take us to San Cristobal. The funniest thing about it was that we noticed my sister and me, and he spoke in English--very, *very* broken English. I mean, he tried! But in all honesty, my sister and I were better off hearing his instructions in Spanish.

But yeah. San Cristobal was okay.

A little while after, we went to a relative's house and stayed there. It was nice and chilly, but it was *so*, **so** bright outside. Here's some context: I'm very blind, so I wear glasses. The glasses I had at the time (they're now broken) had transition lenses, meaning the lenses would darken when exposed to UV light. And there was **so** much sun in that area that my glasses almost turned completely black after just minutes standing out there!

Why was I outside, you wonder? Well, washers and dryers are expensive in Mexico, so most people just buy the washer and dry their clothes outside. Besides, why waste precious electricity or gas when you can harness the power of the **Sun** to dry your clothes?! The only downside is that they get really wrinkly, so you have to iron them. So there I was, hanging up clothes and minding my own business when...

![butterfly on a shirt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70150464/101841701-1309fc80-3b0c-11eb-8776-88fc4f0cc97c.jpg)

...this little guy appeared!

The butterfly just came by and landed on my tie-dye shirt! And it just sat there. For minutes. Maybe longer. I don't remember how long it was before the butterfly finally decided, "Okay, I'm good," and flew away.

So let's discuss the [header!](#bilingual-time) As unrelated as it sounds to San Cristobal, I have something to say! So, I can understand Spanish, but I don't speak it. Do I still count as bilingual?

## Dogs

I own a Western Terrier named Yuki. She's actually one of three dogs we'd gotten when I was a child. Sadly, two of them have passed away already, so Yuki is the only one left.

Yuki is weird. Very weird. But she's cute. She loves belly rubs and chicken. She's got a bit of a nasty habit of following me and my mom around in the kitchen and watching us eat, hoping we'll give her human food.

We have another dog named Oliver. He's a Shi Tzu-Maltese mix, and he's also cute. I think he's rubbing off on Yuki--Yuki is, like, thirteen years old now, but she's gotten into the habit of greeting my mom when she gets home from work and wanting to play! The only other dog we know who does that is Oliver. We think Yuki's also rubbed off on him, as he now gets in the way sometimes and tries to distract us while we're eating.

## Conclusion

Well, that's about all I got to fill the requirements for this project. I can definitely go on about computer classes, but everything else? Nah. Anyway...

```python
	a, b = 0, 1
	while b < 10:
	    print(b)
	    a, b = a, a + b

```
